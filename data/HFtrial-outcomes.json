Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.

Total Treatment phase is 16 weeks. The number 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale will be obtained pre and post 6 minutes walk test. The value of 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale pre 6 minutes walking test will be compared between Randomization visit (Visit1/Week0) and treatment completion (Visit 5/Week 16), and the same type of comparison will be performed for 1-10 Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale values post 6 minute walk test. Rating score is as below: 0=Rest, 1=really easy, 2=easy, 3=moderate, 4=sort of hard, 5=hard, 6= between 5 and 7, 7=really hard, 8=between 7 and 9, 9=really really hard, 10=Maximal: just like my hardest race. Decrease in score value compared between Randomization visit (Visit1/Week0) and treatment completion (Visit 5/Week 16) represents better outcome."

From the 21 questions, the lowest possible total score is 0, and the highest possible total score is 105. A lower score is desirable.
